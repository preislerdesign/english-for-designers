# Draw this!
## Rewrite the instructions
1. Draw five long rectangles next to each others. They have to look alike trading graphs for trading crypto currency.
2. How did they look? First one is longest from bottom to top. Look of that recrangle is just stroke one.
3. Second one is little bit smaller but still holds middle position. This rectangle is full black filled.
4. Third one is again stroke based like the first one but only one difference is lenght. It has same height on top like first one but shorter at the bottom even than the second one.
5. Fourth and Fifth are also stroke types. Their top is at the same line like second one but fourth is same lenght like first one at the bottom and fifth one has same lenght like third one at the bottom.

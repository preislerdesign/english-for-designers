## Style

Few examples how I work with text that I talk about with clients:

# 1. New future logo.
The logo is a symbolic representation of a seedling set in a rounded square. Nature also represents its basic color in green. The structure is rendered using a minimalist style to achieve a simple design.

# 2. Through the eyes of a forester and graphics designer
Thanks to the use of basic colors, the uniqueness of the logo and the connection with a natural touch is significantly strengthened. We created the logo using a golden ratio to achieve maximum accuracy and the rules that we think the logo should meet.

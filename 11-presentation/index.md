This bachelor thesis deals with the creation of a communication strategy and visual for the newly prepared cultural building in Česká Kamenice. The thesis contains the concept of a strategy that seeks to connect cultural institutions of the same type between cities. In the practical part we will find the creation of a visual style from the name, the creation of the logo to the overall style that will be needed, for example, for promotion on social networks.

## A PIECE OF HISTORY

The Česká Kamenice cinema was built in 1912 by Berta and Josef Seiche in just four months.
The Seiches saw film performances not only as a cultural issue, but also as a means to increase
tourism in the city.

City Council
decided to rebuild the old cinema according to new trends, increase the pitch of the auditorium. The action started at the end
November 1987 and lasted until December 1992
